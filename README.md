# BrownNote: My Crappy Web Browser from Scratch
Using common Python libraries I'm constructing a browser 
from the ground up. This is largely a learning project 
for myself, but if you want a browser that only displays text feel free to use it.
\

Right now the browser can only display the raw HTML of a page.

=======
## ToDo
* Isolate headers and paragraphs from HTML
* Fix scrollbars
